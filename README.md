## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Cheeri Operating System, or **CheeriOS** for short, is a simple application made in Java to emulate what an Operating System would look like. It is designed to be a friendly, customizable Operating System. It will include features that allow users to customize how their screen looks like for a comfortable layout. Furthermore, it will include a way for applications to be built into the Operating System. Many features are planned for CheeriOS, as follows:
* A File Manager
* A Browser
* A Terminal Window
* A File Editor designed for Coding
* More!

**Disclaimer:** CheeriOS is not a real Operating System for the following reasons:
* It does not connect harware to software applications.
* It does not include and operate with a low-level language.
* It is designed to be run in a different OS.

However, CheeriOS is designed to look like an Operating System, and maybe a precursor to a new Operating System coming soon!
